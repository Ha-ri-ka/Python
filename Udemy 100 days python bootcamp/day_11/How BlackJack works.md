VALUE OF CARDS:
2 to 10-->face value
J,Q,K-->10
A-->1 or 11, more favourable option is chosen automatically.

OBJECTIVE:
Beat the dealer.

TERMINOLOGY:
hit: to draw a card
stay: to bet on the cards at hand. You cannot draw cards after choosing to stay.
bust: if the card's value goes aboce 21.
blackjack: if the card's value adds up to exactly 21.

GAMEPLAY:
first card to every player including the dealer is dealt face up. 
Second card to every player in dealt face up, to dealer
is dealt face down.

Your cards' value==dealers' cards-->draw (push)
dealer is closer to 21 than u-->you loose
your cards are closer to 21 than dealer's-->you win
if dealer's card are worth<17-->they MUST take another card.
if dealer's card are worth>17-->they CANNOT draw further cards.



BLACKJACK-->u autumatically win 1.5 times your bet from the dealer, youre done for the round.

Once every player is done choosing to hit/stay, the dealer reveals their cards.

if your cards add upto 9,10,11 OR initial two-card hand (depends on casino)--> you can double down
double down::you add whatever amount youve already bet to your bet amount (bet+=bet)
and the dealer deals you exactly one card.

If you have equal number of cards: you can split.
SO each of those cards will be their own bets now, and youll have to add your original bet amount to each of those.
if u have 4,4 and bet was 20: one 4 has a 20 and the other 4 has a 20 now. 
Each of those hands will get another card. You can choose to hit stay on one of em and move to the other. 

if dealer's cards<17-->must hit 
else-->must stay.

dealer busts--> every player that is still in the round gets twice their bet.
dealerdoesnt bust--> players with cards> dealer: win twice their bet
                     players with less than dealer: looses bet.
                     players with same card values as dealer: get their best back.
